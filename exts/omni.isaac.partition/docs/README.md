The Partition utility is used to convert a large USD stage to a stage with smaller sublayers. The layers are generated from the selected cameras in the source stage.  This reorganization allows developers to work in the smaller layer(s) with all of the benefits of a smaller stage while keeping the original structure of the source stage.

In short, it splits a stage into several shots defined by camera views.
